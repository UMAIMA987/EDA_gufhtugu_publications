## What I have done in this project:


Top 10 cities with max orders.

Visualize order status frequency

Payment Method selected by people.

Hidden Pattern of returned orders.

Is Online Payment or Bank transfer reason of cancellation?

# Hidden pattern of Return orders:

Order above than 100 books are mostly returned.We can fix the limit on items order at a time to avoid returns in future.

# Suggestion
We notice that 80% of the orders that are above than 100 items at a time are returned. To avoid returns , we can fix the limit of itmes ordered at a time.

# Analysis report

93% orders are Completed , 5.92% are Returned and 0.77% are Cancelled.

Advance payment(bank transfer, easy paisa , jazz cash) maybe the reason of cancellation of orders.
